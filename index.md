## About Me

I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV) at the University of Central Florida (UCF), working under Dr. Mubarak Shah. My research primarily focuses on adversarial attacks, with early work exploring unwilling knowledge distillation (model stealing) and more recent efforts centered on jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). Currently, I'm investigating how these techniques can be extended to the vision-language model (VLM) domain. I'm always open to discussing research or collaborating, feel free to reach out!

## Research Interests

- **Model Saftey:**  Exploring adversarial attacks on vision models and jailbreak techniques for large language models (LLMs), with a focus on both offensive (attack) and defensive (mitigation and red-teaming) strategies.
